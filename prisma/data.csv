|Wenqin Chen|4|China|Wenqin Chen’s subject of enquiry emerged. Of equal importance, he is passionate about the dialog created between the positive and negative spaces that surround his work.

|Sumit Mehndiratta|4|India|Watch the making of this piece on YouTube: https://youtu.be/05dpTxmGHYI This piece comes box framed with acrylic glass, framed in a white wooden frame. I like creating geometrical patterns through various mediums. I like them to be precise in terms of their shape and construction. Using threads and nails has been one of the many creative ways I could use to make geometrical shapes and have fun with them. Each nail is hammered individually and then I weave the threads through the nails one by one by hand until I get the desired shape and its placement onto the sculpture. Together these shapes create a beautiful complexity and the fine lines of threads mixing with each other create a beautiful, intricate pattern. Around 1600 meters of thread is used to make this art piece.

|Manuel Izquierdo|4|Spain|Materials: Acrylic, wood, magnet, galvanized iron.  Signed in the back. hanging hardware is included.  My creative work focuses on an abstract language of three-dimensional mobile geometric shapes and gives rise to being able to combine with each other inside the support, sometimes they can also be placed outside the support, since the mobile geometric shapes are attached to the support by magnets. This work being three-dimensional I name interactive wall sculpture.  THE POSITIONS OF THE MOBILE  The possibility of the moving parts that compose the work offers me the discovery of other positions. I find it interesting that an open work can show all the possibilities of interesting positions that I can find. The record of each position is kept in photos, drawings, video, etc. Generating thus a compilation of all the positions that belong to the work. The one who owns it can try under its responsibility to discover new positions. That you can change the position does not mean that it moves and changes at random, but it requires a previous effort of imaginative reflection of how the new posture can work.|23.6 W x 29.3 H x 2 D in|3068105-QKJHBJEB-7.jpg|Interactive mobile 0196 Position A Sculpture|2310|3
|Francesca Dalla Benetta|4|Mexico|Origami is a bronze sculpture of a child playing with paper and scissors: he made himself a paper hat. He has a tender and naughty expression on his face, as the children have when they did something they shouldn’t have done: the hand that hides a scissor and the look in the eyes of the boy makes you wonder that he is plotting something. Francesca loves to work with children portraits, because of their innocence and their capacity of wonder. It is part of a project called Los Niños y Sus Amigos Imaginarios (The children and their imaginary friends). It is a special tribute to children’s nature, to their capacity to see through this reality, to maintain the innocence, to have faith in the impossible, to always have hope, to be spontaneous, to be authentic. In this sculpture, the little boy is playing with simple object, but on his mind he is creating wonderful adventures. This piece has a black patina with golden details, polished to reveal the natural bronze color. The gems of the crown are polished with a special garnish to mega their shine. This piece is a unique bronze sculpture, one of a kind. The size includes the base.|11.8 W x 26 H x 9.8 D in|8323685-XJEZVZMB-7.jpg|ORIGAMI Sculpture|7205|1

|Scott Troxel|4|United States|"Part of the Terebellum Series by Scott Troxel, ""Stasis"" is a large, modern, wood wall sculpture.  As with all of Scott Troxel's work, Stasis is retrofuturist, meaning that it is both a nostalgic nod to the past (Mid century modern and Art Deco inspired) while also looking toward the future. The monochromatic color palette puts emphasis on the composition of pieces, without the distraction of color. Sweeping birch wood pieces add a warmth and organic ness to the piece that keeps it from being too modern or cold (again a nod to mid century design).  The bold negative spaces in the piece further emphasize the form and composition of the piece.  Stasis is finished with high end satin pigmented lacquer which appears as an automotive quality finish on both the wood and the off-white pieces.    Recommended to be hung with cleats (included) for support on the wall."|47 W x 56 H x 1.3 D in|8644409-ENZRIEPC-7.jpg|Stasis Sculpture|4800|1

|James Watts|4|Australia|This assemblage sculpture is constructed from recycled materials sourced from an area in Brisbane called Woolloongabba. When viewing art it is often the various impulsive flashes of memory, generated by our past experience with everyday objects, materials and places that link the complexity of the work together. However, it is through the constructive use of what may be considered banal and ordinary objects, united by life as a material composition, art and memory that perception transforms the everyday into something unexpected and extraordinary.|15.2 W x 23.4 H x 1.2 D in|7479065-DBBAWUPM-7.jpg|Shades of Woolloongabba #5 Sculpture|890|3

|Scott Troxel|4|United States|"""Tonka III"" is the last piece in a 3 piece series of monochromatic wall sculptures. Tonka III features a matte metallic gunmetal (Blue steel) finish made from automotive enamel. The result is a stunning metallic surface that absorbs light and looks extremely rich and luxe.  Four different levels of depth and thicknesses on the piece allow for striking shadows when spotlights are used to light the piece. The pinlines are metallic Champagne and red.  Finally, the name ""Tonka"" comes from the inspiration for these pieces.  The pieces are meant to abstractly resemble Native American dancers dressed in monochromatic deerskin outfits.  I tried to capture the send of movement and elegance in a modern cubist manner.  Note: The color of this piece is very tricky to photograph.  Because it is automotive enamel, the paint color changes depending on the angle you are viewing the piece and the ambient light hitting it.  Sometimes it looks blue, sometimes it looks charcoal or grey.  Inside without light, it looks darker, but in natural light it seems blue-ish steel.  It makes for a very cool surface but very hard to show in photos.  Each piece is wired to hang."|25 W x 47.5 H x 1.5 D in|6757653-HSC00002-7.jpg|Tonka III Sculpture|4210|3

THOMSON ART PRIZE Longlisted for the Thomson art prize, curated by Thomson Gallery, Zug, Switzerland This entails a digital show of my glasswork at the Thomson Gallery in Zug, Switzerland and in several international partner galleries during the year 2022, as well as another presentation of my work on ARTSY.  PUBLICATIONS Featured in ANIMA MUNDI art magazine, April 2022  NEW GLASSWORKS Between 1997 and 2003, I made a great many installations and sculptures of industrial glass - a medium difficult to handle but unique as to its infinite esthetical possibilities. These works were regrouped and shown as The Glassworks. The new glassworks that have been created in the course of this year are a logical continuation of the initial series and draw on the technical experience I acquired during that period.  REVERSE GLASS PAINTING The technique of reverse glass painting consists in painting the back side of a glass panel which is then reversed so that the mirror image can be viewed through the glass. The artist plays with light, transparency and reflexions to create abstract and luminous works, often combining the glass with other material like paper, collage and wood."|51.2 W x 58.3 H x 3.1 D in|7873381-OPGFLLJE-7.jpg|from the glassworks GW17/22 (trailblazer) Sculpture|9850|2

|Olga Skorokhod|4|United States|This piece was inspired by the depth of the ocean, natural formations and their textures. Olga explores the different variations that are possible in the composition and plays with the shapes, depth and transitions from light to shadow. She gives the depth to her works by using double-sided sticky foam between the layers. The paper sculpture techniques give the artwork a greater illusion of 3D. To add color and more depth in sculpture she uses blue film between paper layers.|6 W x 6 H x 1.3 D in|9032129-ULAIANUA-7.jpg|Oceanic Symphony Sculpture|455|2

|Nazar Symotiuk|4|Ukraine|"Every choice we make always has consequences, and the most difficult question is how to make the right one in a corrupt and full of horror world. Human nature is weak and in striving for a life in unity and harmony often attracts the opposite. It is significant that the author chose a tree as his medium for the expression of ideological and conceptual searches and knowledge. The sharp corners of the triangles, which aggressively break into the space in the professional composition of the works, attract attention and the upper labyrinths in the center of which is the symbol of sin - an apple. The use of new form-creating approaches marks a new milestone in the artist's creativity: meaningful, balanced and socially acute in terms of subject matter. Everyone has a choice and their own system of moral evaluations. The ""Sin of the Middle"" series is about the beauty of the human soul, which, despite the changeability and temptation of the surrounding world, remains the best and highest creation of God."|40.6 W x 40.6 H x 4.6 D in|9232587-XBMOIAMV-7.jpg|The sin inside 12 Sculpture|3500|2

|Scott Troxel|4|United States|Cathedral is a mixed media wall sculpture. Made from enamel washes on birch, MDF and copper spray enamel.  Finished with a hand waxed process.    Cathedral takes on the abstract form of a soaring building.  Perhaps a church spire or other tall building in form.  But that is secondary to the feeling that the piece envokes which I believe is faith, hope and angelic positivity.   Cathedral is a monochromatic piece which is minimalistic in nature, so the form, composition and the balance of the piece can trump a definitive subject matter.  In this case, Cathedral becomes what the viewer sees in it or what they attach to emotionally within the piece.    It comes wired to hang.|22 W x 42 H x 0.8 D in|4836461-HSC00002-7.jpg|Cathedral Sculpture|3510|2

|Michael James Talbot|4|United Kingdom|Michael Talbot is a British sculptor, born in Staffordshire in the north of England in1959. After completing a BA honours degree in Sculpture, he gained a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Arts in London for post graduate study in 1980, winning the coveted Landseer prize in 1983. He studied further at The Sir Henry Doulton Sculpture School under Colin Melbourne ARCA and Dame Elizabeth Frink RA. Michael was elected a member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1997 and was elected a member of the National Sculpture Society (USA) in 2012. The inspiration for Talbot`s work has always been the human form and its dramatic poetry. It is this, together with his exquisite skills that make his work so individual, intricate and beautiful. Talbot creates the original clay sculpture which he then casts into bronze, uniquely finishing and patinating each sculpture. This process is wholly under his control allowing him to enhance and refine the final image. The wonder and fascination of sculpture is its ability to be a solid form that can be seen, touched and walked around and yet remain an object of pure spirit.  The Bather Collection comprises of 3 sculptures, Midday Sun, Memories and Daydream. They are created to reflect long, lazy, summers days, with sunshine warming the skin.|5.1 W x 9.1 H x 9.4 D in|7702081-HSC00001-7.jpg|MIDDAY SUN Sculpture|6400|1

|Dmytro Shavala|4|Ukraine|"Lao Tzy “Life and death are one thread, the same line viewed from different sides.” Once the day to give yourself up to the infinity will come. To leave your body behind. This makes your life priceless and gives you a key to immortality. If you look at this piece you’ll see a red river. It mysteriously surfaces from the depths of limitless oblivion and disappears immediately beyond the horizon. The circle symbolizes the cyclic nature of the process, the rich texture of the tree seduces with its mystery. The unknown is right in front of you. Do you dare to face the truth? To understand the boundaries of your life? Only the sharp witted and strong willed have the guts to do that.  About series of works ""Birth&Death"": I’ve worked restlessly for two years while contemplating on the fate human life and on the miracle of birth. And finally I’m proud to present you my series of works “Birth&Death”. You are getting closer to the truth. It’s already hard to count the number of books that’ve been read. Nevertheless you are still stubbornly looking for the answer to these eternal questions ""Who am I?"", ""What will happen to me after my death?"", ""Why am I here?"", Is there nothing waiting for me there only darkness? "". These thoughts visit you, don’t they? They visit me and probably every person capable of complex thought.  “Birth&Death” are totem-preachers, that help morph your space into a place of philosophical discoveries.  When I was preparing materials for this series I knew with certainty that it had to be oak. Wood, as its commonly known, is a live material, warm to the touch. Oak wood is a very unique type of wood. Here are a few interesting facts. From ancient times the oak tree was a symbol of power, morality, endurance and knowledge. Also this tree use to be perceived as a conductor of cosmic energy, a gate between two worlds, capable of empowering and enlightening you. In ancient Greece, the rustling leaves of this tree determined the future. This whole series is made in a unique handcrafting technique using the luxurious oak material."|8.7 W x 10.6 H x 3.1 D in|5927907-HSC00002-7.jpg|Red River 2 Sculpture|650|4
|Juliet Vles|4|Switzerland|"CURATED COLLECTIONS This artwork was featured in the ""NEW THIS WEEK"" Collection curated by REBECCA WILSON.  LUNAR  LYRICS Throughout human history, the moon has been a metaphor of the darker side of nature  - of mystery and crime, of trance and insanity and, of course, of creative madness. As a died in the wool rationalist, I have no use for moongoddesses and werewolves  -  even less for the disgusting rites of fascistic moon-sects. But I believe in the beauty of  a moonfrozen landscape, the intuition of sleepwalkers (y compris in science, as Arthur Koestler has so impressively shown), and in the power of the human mind to create poetry out of a moonlight shadow.  The KRYPTA series  Relief and assemblage work, half-painting half-sculpture - geometrical constructions overlaid with painting, drawing and written panels incrusted, intarsia-like, into the supporting frame. The word «Krypta» (from Greek «hidden», «secret») stands for an artistic expression that depicts neither the reality nor the abstraction of our conscious perception of being, but the imago of an unconscious area of the mind not immediately accessible to analytical intelligence."|66.9 W x 44.1 H x 3.9 D in|2450098-HSC00002-7.jpg|L109   study for &quot;lunar lyrics&quot; (2) Sculpture|9200|3

|Kristjana S Williams|4|United Kingdom|Kristjana has taken her acclaimed Skeleton artwork to the next level, creating a stunningly unique pair of original three-dimensional artworks, each rich with fine and bejewelled embroidery pieces as well as intricate giclée paper motifs.  Golden and Violet Bones explore the contradictions associated with being human; from riding high with a mental clarity and spring in the step in one moment, to being thwarted and momentarily immobilised, burdened by the weight of uncertainty in the next. These bones, these ruins of the imagination, are home now to fantastical creatures of sea and air, evolving metaphors for the soul within.  Plants grow from cadaverous bones, breathing new life and creating a stunning composition of colour and shape.   Embrace the colours of the sun, the earth, heat and light. A pair of golden fish encircle the skull, swimming down towards a tropical display of warmth and vitality - the hummingbird and orchid breathing life to the area where the heart is absent.  Trees flourish from the pelvis as swinging arms graze bejewelled insects and tiny butterflies.  A magenta bee tickles the tibia while at the restless feet sits a seductive heron, a symbol of stability and wisdom.  A stunning celebration of nature in 3D: a strong and powerful lion with its family of cubs immediately draw the eye, their monochrome tone a counterpoint to the rich and vibrant border. A kaleidoscope of colour, life and vibrancy brings the inner secrets of the jungle to the fore. From deep in the undergrowth, the eyes of a soulful crane, a stealthy crocodile and radiant flamingo peer out; unseeing, or in warning? Butterflies in every shade of yellow and blue, navigate their tentative path, basking in the force and miracle of nature, uniquely depicted here in Kristjana’s stunningly impactful three dimensional artwork.|26 W x 48 H x 4.3 D in|9569143-MOIQWVIR-7.jpg|VIOLET BONES - CONTEMPLATING SKELETON - ORIGINAL ARTWORK 2023 Sculpture|10265.50|1

|Marina Nelson|4|Canada|"The moon cycle music pours lightly  into my pores. My body dances gently to the eternal rhythm.  An existential exploration of ins and outs, of duality and oneness, of planetary alignments and our moods according to the waning of the moon. I used my own old clothes for ripping them into thin ribbons and then knitting, weaving, crocheting and manipulating new surfaces into oneness - it's about being part of one big self, in the end. The circular form is comprised of two plastic hula hoops bound together with fabric ribbons. The artwork is equipped with hanging wire in the back.  This artwork works well together with its sister creation - ""The Other Side of the Moon -First Appearance"". You can hang them side by side, or slightly buried into each other, like a photo in details shows.

|Manuel Izquierdo|4|Spain|My creative work focuses on an abstract language of three-dimensional mobile geometric shapes and gives rise to being able to combine with each other inside the support, sometimes they can also be placed outside the support, since the mobile geometric shapes are attached to the support by magnets. This work being three-dimensional I name interactive wall sculpture.  THE POSITIONS OF THE MOBILE  The possibility of the moving parts that compose the work offers me the discovery of other positions. I find it interesting that an open work can show all the possibilities of interesting positions that I can find. The record of each position is kept in photos, drawings, video, etc. Generating thus a compilation of all the positions that belong to the work. The one who owns it can try under its responsibility to discover new positions.

|Maria Bouquet|4|United States|Led light. Remote control with 15 colors and 5 light sequences. (Light Art piece battery operated)  The Light Art series is inspired by the Culture of aboriginal peoples of Latin America. These Peoples designed a Geometric language, compose by patterns, shapes and forms that are part of the make up of all living things and that regularly occur in nature. It is system of universal design in which the energy of creation organizes itself into form. The magical realm of geometry expresses itself in the beautiful patterns of creation seen in snowflakes, crystals, flowers and pinecones. The ancient cultures (Celts, Druids, Egyptians, Knights Templar, etc...) and aboriginal peoples (Mayan, Hopi, etc...) were very much aware of these geometrical signatures and numeric frequencies. Experiencing a resonance with these living forms, the ancient peoples recognized the wisdom contained within each shape and built their sites of worship and monuments in harmonious accord with sacred geometry.   The Light Art series is inspired on geometrical patterns find in nature. It is a series of dynamic and three-dimensional body of works that play with the view of the observer. These light art sculptures are born with the illusion that our sight generates thanks to light manipulation. These pieces of light art are focused on altering the perception of light and volume to perceptual and sense experience. Thus, a series of objects floating in an infinite space of colors is perceived. My ultimate goal is to take the observer to a similar state to that experienced through meditation.|32 W x 48 H x 2.5 D in|4101249-HSC00001-7.jpg|Cosmopolitan (vi) Sculpture|5550|1

|Sumit Mehndiratta|4|India|Watch the making of this piece on YouTube: https://youtu.be/7HjYlSDWfBc This piece comes box framed with acrylic glass, framed in a white wooden frame. I like creating geometrical patterns through various mediums. I like them to be precise in terms of their shape and construction. Using threads and nails has been one of the many creative ways I could use to make geometrical shapes and have fun with them. Each nail is hammered individually and then I weave the threads through the nails one by one by hand until I get the desired shape and its placement onto the sculpture. Together these shapes create a beautiful complexity and the fine lines of threads mixing with each other create a beautiful, intricate pattern. Around 1600 meters of thread is used to make this art piece. The plywood in the background is painted with acrylic paint.|49 W x 25 H x 1.5 D in|9638447-YLFMUKBX-7.jpg|Nailed it Series No. 149 Sculpture - Limited Edition of 5|1490|3

|Scott Troxel|4|United States|"""SunGate"" is a minimalist and modernist wood wall sculpture reminiscent of both mid century modern forms and bold graphic design. It is part of my ""Small Pops"" Series which are small in size but feel much larger in a room as the depth and vibrant colors of the pieces command the space. The piece was inspired by my love for simple but bold colors and minimalist patterns combined with organic wood grain. This piece has a modern feel yet also brings a retro vibe which results in an unexpected and contemplative feel to any area which it is placed.    The piece is blue, yellow, white and orange combined with contrasting wood grain sides. The name ""SunGate"" refers to the playful composition of the piece, the color and the overall mid century vibe.  The finish is a matte clear coat and the sides are solid poplar wood.  The result is a fun, sculptural piece of modern art that creates conversation in any room.

|Manuel Izquierdo|4|Spain|My creative work focuses on an abstract language of three-dimensional mobile geometric shapes and gives rise to being able to combine with each other inside the support, sometimes they can also be placed outside the support, since the mobile geometric shapes are attached to the support by magnets.

|Zeljka Paic|4|Bosnia and Herzegovina|“Zeljka Paic has created art that has broken free of its boundaries. While the frames are not discarded, they are re-arranged, opened up or rendered porous so as to unchain the art within and allow it to seep, swirl, crawl or strike out beyond its customary limitations and venture beyond into some other place. What place is this? That we do not know is what makes it so alluring, so daring, so dangerous. The magic lies in the mystery. Paic is not so much exploring as allowing for the possibility of exploration. By removing the constraints, she wants to free both the art and the viewer to dare to sally forth into realms as yet uncharted. Even the names invoke the primal impulses to discovery”. David J.K. Carr The wall sculpture ‘Victory’ was made of acrylic on canvas pressed on the MDF board, and the pieces of the frame.

|Karolina Maszkiewicz|4|United States|Largely inspired by desert landscapes and modern architecture with stark outlines and a clean color pallet. The veneer's outline and wood grains give the illusion of movement in the same way various canyon rock walls do having been carved out by long periods of moving water. The use of the natural elements,  stone, and wood, also helps to project the feeling of being surrounded by and connected to, nature. Combining elements in this seemingly gravity-defying way expresses the symbiotic relationship between species, not so dissimilar to how coral provides an anchor for other organisms to flourish. The composition is meant to connect the viewer to nature’s ferocity and ancient mystery, and to mimic our own small but powerful place in this world.|26 W x 26 H x 18 D in|8155679-CUWRHYDY-7.jpg|Over the River Sculpture|2710|4
|Scott Troxel|4|United States|Citrus is a discreet and elegant minimalist, monochromatic contemporary wall sculpture. It is constructed with birch panels, acrylic washes and completed with a semi-gloss lacquer distressed finish. The acrylic wash allows the wood grain to show through the paint and creates an almost marble-like appearance as the warm brown wood grain shows through the gradient white tones. Citrus is a piece that focuses on the composition, balance, and form by using a limited monochrome color palette. The piece diffuses multiple opacities of white creating a contemplative state or alluding to an upbeat fresh and sophisticated modern vibe.  The bold yellow green background and lime focal point complete the piece.|23 W x 24 H x 1 D in|5822759-HSC00001-7.jpg|Citrus Sculpture|2910|3

|Olga Skorokhod|4|United States|Olga's artwork is a stunning exploration of color and shape that showcases a strong rhythmic connection between space and form. The artwork is composed of rectangles arranged in a chaotic order, with each rectangle connected to the surface at different angles. The white surface of the artwork adapts to its environment and reflects the colors of the vividly colored sides of the rectangles. This creates a beautiful gradient of soft pastel colors that mix together and create a calming color palette. Viewed from the opposite side, the artwork presents a bold and bright color composition that can evoke powerful emotions. These colors stand out from their surroundings and grab the viewer's attention. Olga's use of color and shape in this abstract series is truly remarkable. The playfulness and experimentation with composition is evident, and the result is a sophisticated and visually stunning artwork that balances the excitement of bold colors with the calming effect of pastel gradients.|18 W x 24 H x 1.5 D in|9310023-RVHMYBQP-7.jpg|Colorful Rain - 05 Sculpture|1970|1

|Michele Rizzi|4|Italy|"""Athena and Starman"" it is part of a cycle of sculptures called ""metallic landscapes"". This cycle of sculptures are characterized by a series of characteristics: They are sculptures made on thick metal panels to be positioned preferably on the wall. They are characterized by metal panels with surfaces corroded by time and by aggressive substances, subsequently working with abrasive tools in a sort of descialbo. In fact the surface is left intact or the various layers of paint or rust are eliminated depending on the pictorial effect to be achieved. Once I arrived at abstraction or abstract metallic landscape I was influenced by it in the choice of the figures to be inserted in the context and the technical methods to be implemented. In this case a beautiful paper representation of Athena was inserted which was subsequently painted, impregnated with colored shades, fragmented and worn in order to give the impression of historical ruin / archaeological find and finally protected and treated with transparent varnishes that block over time the effect obtained. In the opposite upper corner there is an idea of ​​a portrait of Starman obtained with elements of stainless steel which is in clear contrast with Athena and finally there is a couple of embraced figures intent on scrutinizing the space into infinity. The latter emerged from the descialbo work and highlighted / finished by means of abrasive wheels. The entire work was finally protected with a transparent gloss that stops the current state of corrosion of the work over time. A very suggestive and iridescent work according to the angle of view. With each movement of the observer, the details that reach the eye change.

|Aby Mackie|4|Spain|The work is created from the deconstruction and re-contextualising of domestic textiles and fabrics sourced from the local market here in Barcelona. The fabrics are dismantled and almost destroyed before being re-imagined and built up methodically through cutting and stitching. It feels like there is magic in the salvation of these fabrics.  Dimensions vary slightly due to the construction method of the artwork.  IMPORTANT: This work has NOT been stretched and does NOT come with a frame, it is intended to be hung directly upon the wall. If you would like to buy the work stretched and/ or stretched and framed please contact me before purchasing.  I am captivated by the unobvious silent material witnesses to a life lived; a worn bed sheet, a stained tablecloth, a moth-eaten gown. Such artefacts bare the marks and physicality of human nature, possessing a poetic power. They are simultaneously valuable in their uniqueness and worthless in their deteriorated, decontextualized state. Each piece created from these objects is therefore both my own personal expression of the hidden memories embedded in the original items, and a way to explore the recycling and re-contextualising of meaning and value in contemporary society. The experience and memories of others, imagined and real, fuse seamlessly with my own through the salvation, destruction and discordant juxtaposition of materials.|22 W x 42 H x 1.5 D in|7693705-HSC00001-7.jpg|Between Chaos &amp; Order 2 Sculpture|1310|3

|Maria Bouquet|4|United States|The En-Lighten project consists of a series of paintings and light installations conceived as an exercise of reflection on light within myself and upon the viewer. Ancient cultures from different latitudes recognized and singled out geometrical forms present in nature that were constant. This appears in Pre Columbian cultures such as the Mexica, the Chavín and the Quechua, from which I draw the inspiration to create pictorial works and mathematical configurations through the use of light looms. The hexagons that give shape to the cells in a honeycomb, the spirals of a shell and infinite series of circles that make up for a flower create the luminous landscapes, the fields of color and define the shape of the light in my work. Modern science encodes a finding in the discovery of the golden number, letter or proportion: Thau, Phi, 1,6180339887498948…thus until dematerializing into mathematical forms and symbols with which the universe as we know it is constructed. It has been observed that the molecular forms that constitute the pilar of life sometimes encompass the same patterns identified in ancient cultures. And it is this very knowledge of sacred symbols and mathematical formulas that enabled, from the construction of many historical buildings like the great pyramids of Egypt, the Greek Parthenon, the intricate temples in Latin America and the iron skyscrapers in New York, to the crystal structures and the lithium of the digital era. The En- Lighten series is inspired in this system of universal design in which the creative energy is organized through natural geometrical patterns. This is a series of works, dynamic and 3D, that create a dialogue with the viewer’s vision. They come from the illusion that our very vision exists as a consequence of light. The pieces set out to alter the notions of light and volume in the perceptive experience. In this way, what is sensed is a group of floating objects that generate an infinite space of colors. As configurations or mandalas with rhythms and variations, they provoke in the beholder an inner dialogue.|20 W x 20 H x 2.5 D in|6011675-HSC00002-7.jpg|Square Universe (iii) Sculpture|2170|3

|Olga Skorokhod|4|United States|The main tool for creating my sculptures is a surgical blade. I give depth to my work by using double-sided sticky foam between the layers. The distinguishing feature is the paper edge cut at an angle, as this creates smoother transitions from light to shadow. The paper sculpture techniques give the artwork a greater illusion of 3D. I used airbrush for the color.  All my sculptures are created by inspiration of nature’s fascinating beauty.|12 W x 12 H x 0.8 D in|3706675-CQKLJVEE-7.jpg|Moon Aura #05 Sculpture|880|2
|Bart Soutendijk|4|United States|This is a 31X 18-inch welded wire wall sculpture of reclining nude. It is made of 3 mm thick (#12 gauge) low carbon steel wire.   I bend the wire by hand and weld it in numerous spots to assure stability, then powder coat it gloss black** with an extremely durable, weather resistant material that makes it suitable for outdoor installation and wet locations indoors.  The sculpture is easily installed on a wall according to instructions I provide.  It is designed to hang approximately 2 inches from the wall surface so that it projects a moving shadow. The piece is signed with a thinner wire.  I make wire wall sculptures for public, commercial, and residential locations. The wire pieces are the final step in a simplification process that starts with a photograph or group of photographs. I make and remake a digital line drawing to emphasize only the essence and feel of the subject, then, like the poet who reviews every word, I re-examine every turn and curve as I bend the wire into a sculpture. The final installation, a solid line in space in front of a moving shadow, has scale enough to suit a large wall without dominating the room. My work has been purchased by collectors from all over the world.   **Other colors are available for a set-up charge of $100.

|Jiahui Wu|4|China|Taijiquan is a Chinese national intangible cultural heritage. The gems of Chinese martial arts have been universally admired around the world. The author use the theme of a little girl doing Taiji to highlight the universality of Tai chi in China. By emphasizing on shaping the girls' expressions and actions, you can see the little girl serious attitude to Tai chi. At the same time, it also reflects the interest of this group sculptures.  The author’s growth process are mostly presented by the works. She likes simple, happy, positive, fun life. In the Works, the little girl are shown in such image----narrow forehead, round face, tight little mouth, lovely expression and being curious about everything. The innocent, lively, healthy and happy figure makes everyone memorable. The apperception of life is the source of creating works. The sculptor not only focuses on the theme ,but also never fail to have an insight into people's inner world. Nothing could be better than the expression of eyes for conveying human beings’ inner world. Her sculptures’ style is to pay attention to the character image as well as the shape of expression , pursuing her perfect works can have a dialogue with the audience.  This series of the tai chi sculptures are colored by bronze material. Every girl has a different color. Bronze material broke the previous single color.

|Scott Troxel|4|United States|Martini is a low relief wall sculpture made from birch panels sprayed with acrylic, distressed then finished with semi-gloss lacquer.  Mounted on a white MDF panel.  Martini is inspired by the drink, of course.  But specifically the idea of having a few friends over in the 1960's and mixing up a few cocktails in your home bar.  Bold poppy colors command attention, while the semi distressed but flat surfaces offer a certain glam factor.  Part party, part uptown chic, Martini is a piece that can serve as the focal point of your room (or bar).|28 W x 28 H x 1 D in|6206999-AVZIJBGM-7.jpg|Martini Sculpture|3700|4

|Jessica Rimondi|4|Germany|“What’s the Matter” reflects on the state of contemporary communication.  Referring to “old school”, handwritten paper scraps as a fresh, quick, analogue, and precious way to exchange thoughts, the reading possibilities of this body of work are various and on different depth layers.  A shift of value and matter: everyday phrases, small talk expressions, exciting or seemingly futile short messages turn from something ephemeral to something of eternal duration. A sheet of paper becomes porcelain, a banal word a piece of art. We glorify the deep significance of small gestures and rediscover the intricate intimacy and power of non-digital written dialogue, giving it back its own dignity, preciousness, and beauty.  Did a note ever change your life?  The “What’s the Matter” series has been realised in porcelain, hand soldered brass and silver. Every work is unique. It is signed, packed in a black magnetic box, and provided with a special nail for the wall installation.

|Aby Mackie|4|Spain|The work is created from the deconstruction and re-contextualising of domestic textiles and fabrics sourced from the local market here in Barcelona. The fabrics are dismantled and almost destroyed before being re-imagined and built up methodically through layering, stitching and cutting. It feels like there is magic in the salvation of these fabrics which is then destroyed, in part, once again, with the application of gold leaf*  This work is ready to hang and has been stretched on a frame with a wooden support.  I am captivated by the unobvious silent material witnesses to a life lived; a worn bed sheet, a stained tablecloth, a moth-eaten gown. Such artefacts bare the marks and physicality of human nature, possessing a poetic power. They are simultaneously valuable in their uniqueness and worthless in their deteriorated, decontextualized state. Each piece created from these objects is therefore both my own personal expression of the hidden memories embedded in the original items, and a way to explore the recycling and re-contextualising of meaning and value in contemporary society. The experience and memories of others, imagined and real, fuse seamlessly with my own through the salvation, destruction and discordant juxtaposition of materials.  *imitation gold leaf|25.5 W x 37.5 H x 1.8 D in|7852680-FEHBBZEP-7.jpg|Between Salvation and Destruction 6 Sculpture|1790|4

|Nico Kok|4|Netherlands|"Video You Tube     Double Column: https://youtu.be/hhM5OC84TaU  Sober and capricious  You may have the idea after a first look at a sculpture by Nico Kok that the form is built from stone elements searched together. This idea will soon be released on closer examination. For how is it possible to find loose elements that showing after stacking such a coherent form.  You realize that first there must have  been a great form and that later smaller elements had formed.  And indeed, this is the method of Nico Kok.. In advance,the choise of material and shape is determined. The preparation is of the upmost importance for the final result.  In the following stage, he takes one of the stones and goes to work as a sculptor. He places his chisel on the stone and splits it into chunks. He works well-considered and steering.Now the lines create that the fracture surfaces bounding. Lines that are later read when the sculpture is ready.  Then comes the stage of sanding and grinding. Thereafter the treated pieces assemled together into a sculpture.They have got a certain individuality, sure, but together they take back the ""large form"" at the beginning of the work. The sulpture is now completed.  The simple and pure in its original form and nature of the material remain present, while the untouchable of the stone is affected and mortality appears to exhibit payful behavior.  Yes, it even has something transform and a smile in the hard stone.  J.D."|4.7 W x 15 H x 3.1 D in|3266921-HSC00001-7.jpg|Double column Sculpture|3070|1
|Francesca Dalla Benetta|4|Mexico|JAGUAR is a bronze bronce of a man with a jaguar mask or hat.  The jaguar occupied a place of supreme importance in pre-Hispanic Mexican culture, being a symbol of profound significance in several indigenous civilizations that inhabited the territory (Maya, Aztecs, Olmecs, etc.).  Its relevance extended throughout religious, social and spiritual aspects, establishing an intimate connection between the animal and the beliefs of these cultures. Some of the main attributes associated with it are: power and strength, spirituality and connection with the divine, symbol of night and darkness (duality and cycles of life and death), protection and spiritual guidance, etc.  This piece is part of a special collection Francesca Dalla Benetta started in 2018, called Customs and Identities, and it is a reflection about how many costumes we wear in front of people, the society, family and so on. We have roles that are different for each person we meet in life, so we try to adapt and respond to that particular role. Sometime we align, sometimes we react. That is how we build our personality.  Please remember that this piece is part of a series of 8, and the patina (colors) may vary a little from piece to piece (I always try to make them the most similar, but part of the patina's beauty is exactly their uniqueness).

|Nazar Symotiuk|4|Ukraine|"Every choice we make always has consequences, and the most difficult question is how to make the right one in a corrupt and full of horror world. Human nature is weak and in striving for a life in unity and harmony often attracts the opposite. It is significant that the author chose a tree as his medium for the expression of ideological and conceptual searches and knowledge. The sharp corners of the triangles, which aggressively break into the space in the professional composition of the works, attract attention and the upper labyrinths in the center of which is the symbol of sin - an apple. The use of new form-creating approaches marks a new milestone in the artist's creativity: meaningful, balanced and socially acute in terms of subject matter. Everyone has a choice and their own system of moral evaluations.

|Macarena Salinas Amaral|4|Chile|"The circle, perhaps the most recurring figure in my work, adopts, depending on the material or the tool that I use, different appearances, some more expressive and others more contained. This ""circulismo"", without beginning or end, is consistent with my working method: to reiterate without a clear, hidden purpose, a basic and current action, a mantra perhaps, a very concrete (geometric) image and, at the same time, very ambiguous and with multiple connotations. There is a counterpoint in the interior and exterior of the work, in the smooth and in the textured, where the smooth with a defined shape is contrasted with the textured with an irregular shape, the smooth emerges from the texture transforming itself. The space is tensed by the interaction between the empty and the full of the form. The circle is related to the smooth, and to the concrete image of its shape"|19.3 W x 19.3 H x 8.3 D in|6924572-HSC00001-7.jpg|Union Sculpture|3170|4

|Olga Skorokhod|4|United States|This piece was inspired by the depth of the ocean, natural formations and their textures. Olga explores the different variations that are possible in the composition and plays with the shapes, depth and transitions from light to shadow. She gives the depth to her works by using double-sided sticky foam between the layers. The paper sculpture techniques give the artwork a greater illusion of 3D. To add color and more depth in sculpture she uses blue film between paper layers.|6 W x 6 H x 1 D in|9008039-NGRDXMUE-7.jpg|Underwater Paradise Sculpture|455|2

|Nico Kok|4|Netherlands|During the pandemic, Nico Kok collected many used construction toys from second-hand stores and internet, including lego In this work he only used the white lego: The current Lego bricks were created in 1958. This work consists of very old, frequently used bricks and fairly new, almost unused stones, which is why the stones are sometimes discolored and have many signs of wear,others are still like new and still shiny.  The white lego bricks have been combined into a relief of twenty five negative pyramids. But in these work you can also  see a square pattern. The work reflects on the Nul group movement (Jan Schoonhoven, Armando) and on the minimal artist Frank Stella. Themes by Nico Kok such as: square,pyramid, what can be done with the shape, use of material properties, use of monochrome color,pattern, diagonal,negative/positive,etc., are reflected in this work. The work is signed on the back. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwkLEU7fpTQ|22.4 W x 22.4 H x 1.6 D in|7611624-HSC00001-7.jpg|Twenty five negative white lego pyramids Sculpture|3270|1
|Scott Troxel|4|United States|Mint is an elegant modern and minimalist contemporary wall sculpture. It is constructed with birch panels and acrylic washes and completed with a semi-gloss lacquer finish. The backer is painted with metallic rose gold enamel which is visible through the negative space between the individual pieces above. The acrylic washes allow the wood grain to show through the paint and creates an almost marble-like appearance as the warm brown wood grain shows through the gradient white tones. Mint is a piece that focuses on the movement of the composition, balance, and form by using a limited monochrome color palette (White, off-white, mint green and wood tones). The result is a striking piece which creates a contemplative state or alludes to an upbeat fresh modern vibe without being overly cold, as the organic wood forms work to ground the piece.|24 W x 36 H x 1 D in|7077570-ICRLPCHF-7.jpg|Mint Sculpture|3410|2

|Francesca Dalla Benetta|4|Mexico|Uomo Lupo is a bronze sculpture of a man with a wolf mask or hat. The title means Wolf Man. The wolf is a symbol of courage and bravery, guardianship, and loyalty. A wolf is strong in its instincts, does not waver and knows who it can trust. They teach us to trust in our hearts and minds and to be in control of our own destiny. This piece is part of a special collection Francesca Dalla Benetta started in 2018, called Customs and Identities, and it is a reflection about how many costumes we wear in front of people, the society, family and so on. We have roles that are different for each person we meet in life, so we try to adapt and respond to that particular role. Sometime we align, sometimes we react. That’s how we build our personality. This piece has a black and green patina, the classical bronze colors. The black patina is made from the green one, after the burning process, so magical and mystical.  This sculpture is series of 6 pieces. The size includes the base.|5.5 W x 19.7 H x 5.1 D in|8220645-FOSKUZUO-7.jpg|UOMO LUPO Sculpture|3020|1

|Claus Gawin|2|Denmark|Me . . . Claus Gawin, born in Denmark. In my mid-sixties my passion for art came into light and I started experimenting with acrylic colors. I was inspired by Gerhard Richter after a trip to The Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin in 2014. Here I saw a painting there change my way of art. Gerhard Richter, and his powerful, expressive artworks with an amazing combination of colors change my life. After practice with self-made large squeegees I was able to establish my own technique and a unique style with a high recognition value. If people ask why I use acrylic colors only my explanation is, that acrylic colors are the material there fit my style. My paintings are being sold in many countries worldwide, mostly in the US and EU. About my Art: The best part? It’s all a grand experiment. I am happier knowing that. My works are included in many Saatchi Art featured collections.|39.4 W x 27.6 H x 1.4 D in|9431975-HPHDMCYM-7.jpg|Reflection No. 017 Painting|1610|2

|Claus Gawin|1|Denmark|Me . . . Claus Dalton Rosenkilde (Claus Gawin). In my mid-sixties my passion for art came into light and I started experimenting with acrylic colors. I was inspired by Gerhard Richter after a trip to The Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin in 2014. Here I saw a painting there change my way of art. Gerhard Richter, and his powerful, expressive artworks with an amazing combination of colors change my life. After practice with self-made large squeegees I was able to establish my own technique and a unique style with a high recognition value. If people ask why I use acrylic colors only my explanation is, that acrylic colors are the material there fit my style. My paintings are being sold in many countries worldwide, mostly in the US and EU. And for me as much as it is valid for Gerhard Richter, and to say it in his words: „My artworks are smarter than me“ and I can only influence up to 80 % of the actual outcome. About my Art: The best part? It’s all a grand experiment. I am happier knowing that.|78.7 W x 66.9 H x 0.8 D in|8625629-LQHZKDSC-7.jpg|Abstract No. 245 Painting|4950|3

|Claus Gawin|1|Denmark|Me . . . Claus Gawin, born in Denmark. In my mid-sixties my passion for art came into light and I started experimenting with acrylic colors. I was inspired by Gerhard Richter after a trip to The Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin in 2014. Here I saw a painting there change my way of art. Gerhard Richter, and his powerful, expressive artworks with an amazing combination of colors change my life. After practice with self-made large squeegees I was able to establish my own technique and a unique style with a high recognition value. If people ask why I use acrylic colors only my explanation is, that acrylic colors are the material there fit my style. My paintings are being sold in many countries worldwide, mostly in the US and EU. And for me as much as it is valid for Gerhard Richter, and to say it in his words: „My artworks are smarter than me“ and I can only influence up to 80 % of the actual outcome. About my Art: The best part? It’s all a grand experiment. I am happier knowing that.|47.2 W x 39.4 H x 0.8 D in|5724845-HSC00001-7.jpg|Abstract No. 157 Painting|1860|2
